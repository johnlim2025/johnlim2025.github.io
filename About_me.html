                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>My name is John Lim, and I'm a second-year undergraduate student at 
                    Northwestern University pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering
                </p>
                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>Coming from a family of software engineers, I was exposed to various fields of study of 
                    computer science from an early age. Currently, I'm interested in artificial intelligence 
                    and Machine learning. To explore my interests, I've been part of HABits Lab at Northwestern University, working on
                    a research project focused on mHealth apps that incorporates signal processing and 
                    machine learning.
                </p>
                <h1>Background/Personal</h1>
                <p>I was born in South Korea, and moved to a suburb of Chicago when I was 10 years old. 
                    I'm still deeply attached to my Korean heritage and respect the korean culture. You will find me 
                    listening to Korean indie music and watching Korean dramas a lot in my free time. Apart from that,
                    I enjoy playing various types of sports such as soccer aand volleyball.
